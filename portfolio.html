            <p>Just to remind me that an MMO isn't all sweetness and light, I encountered an Imperial L50 on Tatooine the other day. The controls do everything you would expect, even allowing you to touch the characters and enemies you want to perform an action without forcing you to utilize old school menus. I was able to mow down the zombies in Kingsmouth faster with the new, barely any points character than I could with my elder Paladin-deck character. What I do feel qualified to spend a little bit of time talking about is how your mana and spells feel before you enter a raid environment.</p>
